#### Release Experience

The process is thorough but easy to navigate. I answered a lot of questions that I was pretty unsure of the answer to.
Lots of things to look into for the release of a real deal application. Based on how unsure I am about my answers to those questionnaires,
I don't exactly feel comfortable doing an actual release currently. 
Creating a privacy policy was extremely easy, I wonder what's in mine... 
Resolving android studios warning was extremely tedious and annoying. Lots of warnings generated by default components, silly.
